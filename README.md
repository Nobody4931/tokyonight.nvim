# tokyonight.vim
my own take on the [tokyo night colorscheme](https://github.com/zatchheems/tokyo-night-alacritty-theme "why hello there")

### why did you make this?
because every other colorscheme sucks. not enough purple. \
.. though this one may have too much purple

### whats that javascript file doing over there
thats a generator script i wrote to create the colors/\*.vim files for me from a json config file because there is no way in hell am i writing out every hex and x256 color out by myself with terrible syntax highlighting and formatting

### the code in that generator script seems oddly familiar
thats because its literally the javascript version of [felipec's generator script](https://github.com/felipec/vim-felipec "stop hovering and click") but with some extra features \
his was in ruby and didnt run on literally any platform besides linux, and since im an idiot running windows 10, i needed my own version \
though if youve seen that file before god damn you must browse github a whole lot

### why did you credit the alacritty tokyo night theme instead of the original?
because i saw the alacritty theme first and now im too emotionally attached to it

### you know theres already a tokyo night theme right?
yes but that one also sucks, the colors are a mess. this one looks nicer imo

### your opinion doesnt matter
yeah, and yours doesnt either
